- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Blaine,
- I am 2 required courses shy of a computer science degree due to scheduling changes done by the university. I will be completing them as they are offered.
- I have previously completed a degree in Mathematics and a second degree in Finance. 
- I have previously worked in Banking, with jobs including service, sales, and management. 

I am interested in game development, but I enjoy every aspect of computer science I have studied this far.
Unfortunately many of my class assignments are not allowed to be shared publicly.
